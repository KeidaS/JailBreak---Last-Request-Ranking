# JailBreak---Last-Request-Ranking
Last Request Ranking for JailBreak servers - CS:GO. Works with sm_hosties and MyJailBreak Plugins.


By default, player only obtains points if there are minimum 10 players on the server. To change this value create a file lr_rank.cfg on: ./csgo/cfg/sourcemod/hosties_lr.cfg and add:

"min_players" "VALUE"
